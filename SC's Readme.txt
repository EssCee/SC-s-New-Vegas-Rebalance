Requirements: NVSE (https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE/releases/), *will* blow up otherwise, Archive Invalidation Invalidated (https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/35935). 

Recommended: 4GB patcher (https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552), less likely to get OOM (out of memory) crashes.

DON'T USE THIS WITH OTHER GIANT OVERHAULS. You will blow up. I'm serious. Just don't.

1. You'll want to drag these into your base Fallout folder (Where your .exe is for New Vegas)

2. Make a few changes to your Fallout configuration files:

Fallout_default.ini (In your root folder)
Fallout.ini (In your documents/My Games/FalloutNV folder)
FalloutPerfs.ini (In your documents/My Games/FalloutNV folder)

Find the line: 
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles and set that to 1 (Default is 0)

If you are using TTW, you'll also want to change these lines in the same files above:

SCharGenQuest and set that to 001FFFF8
sIntroMovie and leave it blank (ex: sIntroMovie=)

3. Once the files are in their appropriate locations, activate SC's Mod.esp in your Game Launcher's data files or in a mod manager.
ONLY activate SC's Mod TTW.esp if you are actually using TTW or you WILL crash!

Optional Stuff:
Talking Heads: Drag the menu/textures folder from Optional Additions/Talking Heads into your data folder. Makes the dialog menu like the talking head overlay from Fallout 1/2.
