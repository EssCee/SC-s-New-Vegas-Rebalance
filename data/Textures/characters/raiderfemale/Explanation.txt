NV Female Raider Skins_Dirty

I liked this particular mod because it looks very realistic and it gives that dark, gritty feel that I am trying to add to Fallout New Vegas.
This mod of course requires Black Blossom's textures in its entirety to work.

The changes I made on this texture was made the nose look a bit more clean and repatched a couple things.

Full credit goes to BlackBlossom. 

I formulated much of the female raiders (the ones I could find in plain view) according to this texture.

BlackBlossom's Dirty Raider skin is very lore-friendly.
