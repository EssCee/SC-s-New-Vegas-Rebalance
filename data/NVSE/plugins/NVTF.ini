;This plugin now requires Windows 7 or above (sorry, XP and Vista)

[Main]
;Fix for the dreaded 64Hz bug, it's also required for the high fps fix below
bGTCFix = 1

;Self Explanatory
bFastExit = 1

;Inline dumb obsidian functions. Can help with load times and other stuff
bInlineCommonFunctions=1

;This adds a spin to some critical sections (if you don't know, it's for multithreading). 
bSpinCriticalSections=0

;This modifies vanilla DX9 behavior so textures don't get mirrored into RAM and offers D3D9X as an option. D3D9Ex is necessary for exclusive fullscreen
;it offers some extra features, too
;Massive RAM usage decrease expected
;If you plan to use ENB for whatever reason, you'll have to use windowed mode or OneTweak unless you enjoy alt tab crashes.
;Disabled by default due to the aforementioned alt tab crash if procedures aren't followed correctly

bModifyDirectXBehavior=1

;Experimental Hooks.

bEnableExperimentalHooks=1

;Forces the game to use the value in the brightness slider even in windowed mode (works well with OneTweak)
;Experimental, can cause issues after exiting the game if the game is forcefully terminated, disabled by default
bAllowBrightnessChangeWindowed=0
[DirectX]
;You must enable this if you're using exclusive fullscreen, otherwise your game WILL crash on alt tab
;It's recommended to enable it, anyway, most benefits below require it.
;You might find out this setting can make your performance worse, in that case, disable it and use windowed mode or a borderless mod such as OneTweak
;bModifyDirectXBehavior must be set to 1 to enjoy all the benefits of D3D9Ex
;This setting is 100 incompatible with ENB, no way around it. If you plan to use ENB for whatever reason, you'll have to disable this and use windowed mode or OneTweak unless you enjoy alt tab crashes.

bUseD3D9Ex=1

;Toggle triple buffering. Can help with vSync related fps dips.
;Disable this and FlipEx if for some reason you experience an unintended fps cap to your refresh rate AND for some reason you want to play above the refresh rate of your monitor.

bToggleTripleBuffering=1

;Makes D3D9 manage resources instead of your driver 

bD3D9ManageResources=0
;requires bToggleTripleBuffering to be enabled
;You can set the number of backbuffers from a minimum of 1 (double buffering) to a maximum of 4 (quintuple buffering?)
;default is 2 (triple buffering), it's best not to touch it, but it can safely be increased to 3 or maybe even 4 (only if you're using d3d9ex, the maximum without it is 3), though 2 is still ideal. 3 might help, though
;double buffering is bad performance wise

iNumBackBuffers=2

[D3D9Ex]


;This section is only valid if bUseD3D9Ex is enabled

;Opt in into the FlipEx swapchain mode. Better Alt Tab in fullscreen likely.
bUseFlipExSwapMode=0

;Dynamic resources are safer, yet they can carry a performance penalty. Disable this if you want some extra performance
bUseDynamicResources=1

[GTC]
;FPS Fix. Simple as that. You don't actually need this if your fps are below 50
bFPSFix=1

[FPSFix]
;Set this to your fps cap plus 60. Putting it at 0 will remove the max checks, but it will definitely have repercussions if you plan to Alt-Tab, and it's generally NOT recommended.
;If you can't stand the spider fingers bug and your max fps are 60, ignore above, set this to 59, ensure you limit your fps to 59 or 60
iMaxFPSTolerance=118
;If you know you're able to get more than 24 fps all the time, put this at your desired minimum. Otherwise, leave it. The absolute minimum would be 1. But I would strongly discourage to go below 20.
iMinFPSTolerance = 24
;Like SKSE Havok Fix
bfMaxTime=1
;lipsync fix
fDialogFixMult=2.000

[Experimental]
;This is the equivalent of a very famous tweak in a similar mod to this (Renderer+0x180 suppress) (Hook Critical Section) (experimental) (if your game implodes, we don't know each other).
bRemoveRCSafeGuard=1
;This one is even more experimental, Renderer+0x80 removal (causes more issues than the one above, don't use unless you know what you're doing)
bRemove0x80SafeGuard=0

[CS]
;Spin for all of your critical sections. Uncomment to enable. I'd recommend to disable unless you want to, well, experiment. Non negative values enable it, 0 simply means it won't allocate debug information like vanilla does.
;iSpinCount=0
