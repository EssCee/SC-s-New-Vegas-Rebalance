; Report any bugs and performance issues to the Nexus page.

; NOTE: Default settings here will work fine for most setups.


[Main]

; Fixes the 64hz microstutter issue. Settings are under [GTC].
bGTCFix = 1

; Prevents the game from hanging on exit.
bFastExit = 1

; Optimizes the game's hashtables which reduces menu lag. Settings are under [Hashtables].
bRedoHashtables = 1

; Modifies the vanilla DirectX 9 behavior. Settings are under [DirectX].
bModifyDirectXBehavior = 0

; Miscellaneous threading tweaks which improve overall performance. Settings are under [ThreadingTweaks].
bEnableThreadingTweaks = 1

; Used for debugging. Do not use unless you know what you're doing. 
bAllowDirectXDebugging = 0


[GTC]

; Allows you to run the game at framerates beyond 60 without encountering physics issues.
bFPSFix = 1

; Alternate GTC fix which is more compatible with older systems, but not as accurate.
bAlternateGTCFix = 0

; This removes the GTC limits. It should only be used if your game is running at the wrong speeds.
; You will need to cap your framrate manually with this enabled.
bRemoveGTCLimits = 0


[ThreadingTweaks]

; Improves overall performance.
;Set this to 1 if you're experiencing crashes, mode 1 is safer but it might be more stuttery (less so than vanilla though)
iTweakRCSafeGuard = 2 
;Even more performance tweaks
bTweakMiscRendererSafeGuard = 1

; Extra critical section tweaks.
bTweakMiscCriticalSections = 1

;Possible fix for randomly occuring freeze and crash (most noticeable in TTW)
bReplaceDeadlockCSWithWaitAndSleep=1

[FPSFix]

; Warning: This is a threshold and does NOT cap your frame rate.
; Maximum tolerance for the high FPS fix. Ensure your FPS does not exceed this setting.
; Leave it alone unless you know what you're doing
iMaxFPSTolerance = 500

; Minimum tolerance for the high FPS fix. Leave alone unless you know what you're doing.
iMinFPSTolerance = 10

; Fix for physics issues caused by high FPS.
bfMaxTime = 1

; Fix for the "spider hands" bug.
bSpiderHandsFix = 1


[DirectX]

; This prevents textures from getting mirrored into RAM and reduces overall memory usage.
; Using OneTweak (windowed mode) or DXVK is recommended with this setting enabled, otherwise you won't be able to alt-tab back into the game.
bUseDefaultPoolForTextures = 1

; Enables triple buffering which can provide smoother and more consistent FPS. Disabled by default because it adds an extra backbuffer, potentially increasing input lag.
bToggleTripleBuffering = 0


[Hashtables]

; Resizes the hashtable bucket space.
bResizeHashtables = 1

;Patches that I wouldn't call "proper fixes" but work
[Hacks]
;Patch for the water LOD bug 
bWaterLODPatch=0
